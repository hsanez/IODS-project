Hello, testing this!! ZOM!


Hello World, why are my commits not pushing through?

I _was_ feeling happy and motivated! I got R, Rstudio, Git and Github up and running.
Now I see my commits on Github but unfortunately my diary is not updating.
Apparently, according to Github, the updated of a public page may take up to 24h. I feel like that is a very long time and I wonder if commits made directly on (not remotely with Git) Github would take as long.

I discovered the IODS-course on an email sent to all doctoral schools. I'm looking forward to learning about rMarkdown, project management in Github and clustering.

Looking forward to this course!


**Update**: I got to attend our course IT-help-zoom. It was great! Even though my diary did not update despite our efforts. Apparently everything looks good and my diary should update if I wait some more. The info was reassuring so I'm waiting more serenely now! I did read from GitHub Guides that updating a public page might take up to 24h to update so maybe we'll see some great changes tomorrow!

Meanwhile, I'll keep myself busy with [R for Health Data Science](https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/) as suggested during the course introduction lecture. It seems very informative and easy to read. I'm somewhat familiar with R but I haven't used tidyverse much. Piping gets me a bit confused but it's my favorite topic! Exercise Set 1 seems interesting, it did require some package installations, but I'm good to go now and ready to keep working now that all packages are...packed along!
