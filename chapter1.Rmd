Hello, testing this!! ZOM!


Hello World, why are my commits not pushing through?

I _was_ feeling happy and motivated! I got R, Rstudio, Git and Github up and running.
Now I see my commits on Github but unfortunately my diary is not updating.
Apparently, according to Github, the updated of a public page may take up to 24h. I feel like that is a very long time and I wonder if commits made directly on (not remotely with Git) Github would take as long.

I discovered the IODS-course on an email sent to all doctoral schools. I'm looking forward to learning about rMarkdown, project management in Github and clustering.

Looking forward to this course!
