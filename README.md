# HEY COURSE REVIEWER Assigment 1!

## Please check my commit history to see that my repo and diary were working correctly.
I have made changes since the assignment deadline closed, please don't mind those even though they may have made the reviewing process harder for you, I'm very sorry!!

So to help you out, I think these requirements are/were satisfied:
- [x] GitHub repository and course diary for IODS Project created
- [x] some reflections/comments appear in the course diary together with the author name in the headings
- [x] commit messages can be seen in the GitHub repository
- [x] the course diary has been updated accordingly

--> 20/20 ;)

Kind regards,
Heini
