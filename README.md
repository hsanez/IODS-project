# HEY COURSE REVIEWER Assigment 1!

## Please check my commit history to see that my repo and diary were working correctly already before our deadline (in case that's what you are wondering).
I have made changes to my diary even after the assignment deadline closed, please don't mind those even though they may have made the reviewing process harder for you, I'm very sorry!!

So to help you out, I think these requirements were satisfied already before our deadline:
- [x] GitHub repository and course diary for IODS Project created
- [x] some reflections/comments appear in the course diary together with the author name in the headings
- [x] commit messages can be seen in the GitHub repository
- [x] the course diary has been updated accordingly

--> 20/20 ;)

I hope this helped so you don't need to worry about the time stamps. :)

Kind regards,
Heini
